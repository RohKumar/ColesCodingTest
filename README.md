# I have Used Visual Studio 2026 to code this project which by default creates .slnx files for solution files.
# If you are using an older version of Visual Studio, please rename the .slnx file to .sln to open the solution correctly.
# I tried to keep the code compatible with older versions of Visual Studio as well. downgraded from .net10 to .net9 as the original code

# If you encounter any issues, please let me know.
# Thank you for your understanding!
